        systems are currently added or removed from canvas or paused.

        **number_entities** (NumericProperty): This is the current number of 
        entities in the system. Do not modify directly, used to generate 
        entity_ids.

        **gamescreenmanager** (ObjectProperty): Reference to the 
        GameScreenManager your game will use for UI screens.

        **currentmap** (ObjectProperty): Reference to the current GameMap 
        object

        **entities** (list): entities is a list of all entity objects, 
        entity_id corresponds to position in this list.
